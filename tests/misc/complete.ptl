# Simple Practical example
politely say | : {
  greeting : mutable extract ["milord"] from @2["greeting" --> text]
  if greeting is [] then
    say combination of [@1, ", ", greeting]
  otherwise
    say "you're being rude"
}

my greeting : "milord"
politely say "not a chance" ["greeting" --> my greeting]


# More random integration testing
hello {
  hello : oh yes
  this is a [
    map example,
    I think it works "yes it does"
  ]
  say @1 # hello
  get @2[hello]
}
hello "me"

hello {
  [
    [a map can contain a map],
    yes it can --> 6,
    {
      and blocks with | placeholders too : yes
    }
  ]
}
